This repository contains the code and necessary files to build and run the **Pedestrian Audio Wearable System (PAWS)** smartphone applications.

PAWS is a low-power connected system for improving pedestrian safety in current and future smart cities. PAWS uses microphones embedded into a headset combined with low-power feature extraction, signal processing, and machine learning, for detecting, localizing, and providing alerts of oncoming vehicles to pedestrians in noisy environments.

* Note: The PAWS project was at some point known as SEUS, which is why SEUS is used at some points rather than PAWS.

The contents of this repository are summarized below.

* **PAWS**: Contains the source code and necessary files for the Pedestrian Audio Wearable System (PAWS) smartphone application.
	* Application: Contains the Android project for building and loading the PAWS smartphone application.
	* SEUS: This folder contains the PAWS car detection and localization classifier models. To run the PAWS smartphone application, this folder must be placed into the *Downloads* folder of the smartphone.
* **PAWS_LE**: Contains the source code and necessary files for the Pedestrian Audio Wearable System Low-Energy (PAWS LE) smartphone application. PAWS LE is the low-energy variant of PAWS and has finer granularity car localization, achieved by using a technique called *Angle via Polygonal Regression (AvPR)*.
	* Application: Contains the Android project for building and loading the PAWS LE smartphone application.
	* SEUS: This folder contains the PAWS LE car detection and localization classifier models. To run the PAWS LE smartphone application, this folder must be placed into the *Downloads* folder of the smartphone.
* **PAWS_Features**: Contains the Android project for the test application that displays the raw features obtained from the PAWS/PAWS_LE headset.
* **PAWS_Wireless_Latency**: Contains the Android project for the test application that measures the wireless latency between the PAWS/PAWS_LE headset using a button connected to the smartphone's audio jack.

# Reproducing the PAWS system

To reproduce the PAWS system, you must first install the PAWS smartphone application; details on how to do this can be found in the **PAWS/Application/** folder.

Next, you must reproduce the PAWS front-end PCB. Details on how to do this can be found in the PAWS-FrontEnd repository.

# Using the PAWS Smartphone Application

A manual detailing how to use the smartphone application can be found in **PAWS/PAWS_Manual.pdf**. This file details basic app usage and how to train your own car detection models.

# Reproducing the PAWS LE System

To reproduce the PAWS LE system, you must first install the PAWS LE smartphone application; details on how to do this can be found in the **PAWS_LE/Application/** folder.

Next, you must reproduce the PAWS LE front-end PCB. Details on how to do this can be found in the [PAWS-FrontEnd repository](https://github.com/Columbia-ICSL/PAWS-FrontEnd).

# Using the PAWS Smartphone Application
