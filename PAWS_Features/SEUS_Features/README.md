# SEUS FEATURES

This Android application can be used to connect to the PAWS/PAWS_LE headset to read and display raw features from the headset.

This code was originally adapted from the Android-nRF-UART application version 2.0.1 from Nordic Semiconductor.

* Note: The PAWS project was at some point known as SEUS, which is why SEUS is used at some points rather than PAWS.
